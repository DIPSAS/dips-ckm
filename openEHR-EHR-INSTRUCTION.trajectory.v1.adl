Trajectory is the path followed by a projectile flying or an object moving under the action of given forces.

This Instruction should be used to initiate plans that should facilitate a specific pathway for the patient. The purpose of the Instruction is to give enough information for the healthcare provider to follow up the treament as a trajectory. ">
