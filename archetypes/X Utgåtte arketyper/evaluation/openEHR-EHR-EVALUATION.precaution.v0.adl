Precautions are evaluative/summary statements; not a diagnosis or a test result. Each precaution can be optionally linked to a diagnosis, test result or medication order that is evidence/rationale for the precaution. 

Examples of precautions:
- Immunosuppressed/on immunosuppressive therapy – linked to medication order for chemo or steroids; or diagnosis of leukaemia.
- Dialysis – linked to renal function tests and/or diagnosis of renal failure.
- Family member is immunosuppressed – so might reconsider administration of a live vaccine to the subject.
- Is waiting for organ transplant.
- Ongoing investigation or follow up of suspected or verified malignant disease.
- Participation in pharmacological trials.
- Anticoagulant treatment.
- Known serious psyciatric disorder.
