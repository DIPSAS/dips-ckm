            purpose = <"A Modified Early Warning Score is a bedside score and track & trigger system that is calculated by nursing staff from the observations taken.  It is reflective of patient deterioration based on vital sign derangement and is a valuable additional tool to facilitate the early detection of deteriorating patients.  This is especially important in acute wards where patients are often quite unwell and there may be many inexperienced staff.  Vital signs are inclusive of Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Temperature, and Respiratory Rate, however the MEWS includes other observations as well.

A “vital” sign is a sign that pertains to life, without which life would not exist. Derangements in Pulse and Blood Pressure measurements can reflect an increased risk of life not existing and so can be considered a “vital sign”.  If derangements in Respiratory Rate, Heart Rate and Blood Pressure measurements reflect an increase in the risk of death, it is important that these signs are detected early and appropriate treatment is delivered to not only normalise these signs, but also decrease the risk of the patient dying.

The MEWS looks at all the observations together, not just a single observation in isolation. It includes Respiratory Rate, Oxygen Saturations, Temperature, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Sedation Score, and Urine Output.">
